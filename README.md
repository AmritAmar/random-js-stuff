# random-js-stuff
A repository to post random stuff I do with JS, something I am trying to learn to better understand front end development. I am just going to use this to sync up random tutorials/stuff I do. More official things I make will go into other repositories.

Just following tutorials from codingtrain/twitter graphics stuff/code bullet/others.
